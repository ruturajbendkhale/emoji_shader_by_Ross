# Microsoft Segoe UI Emoji SVGs Icons

![Emoji Banner](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/480941043/3f3ab8a5-462d-4c4e-8aa3-852e1ad95bea)

3070 Vector based [Emoji-12.0](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-12.0/) icons out of the Windows 10 style from the 
[Microsoft Windows 10 May 2019 Update](https://emojipedia.org/microsoft/windows-10-may-2019-update/). 
The icons are available in SVG and high quality PNG. 

The Windows 10 version has its own simple, succinct and even hilarious style. 
It works great on light or dark themes. Unfortunately even on Windows itâ€™s not possible to use it with every software. 
Using them directly in vector graphics is very cumbersome and worst case: every platform displays it differently. 
This repo should help to get a better access to this great font.
